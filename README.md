# Tsama
This is still a work in progress (WIP)

Tsama is a lightweight php framework/cms in the early stages of development.

The name tsama comes from the tsama melon of the Namib and Kalahari deserts from my country, Namibia. Tsama signify the life that is available for free to those that roam these deserts. In the same way, Tsama code is available for free to all that roam the internet.

# Intro
The idea is to have multiple services running within a lightweight framework. As an example a page is ran as a service with a pageworker handling certain things such as keeping a catalogs of articles.
